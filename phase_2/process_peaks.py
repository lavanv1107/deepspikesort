    There are peaks that were detected which are spikes. We can verify this using the spikes information within the NWB file.
    However, there are peaks which are not exact spike matches but they are very close and can be considered as such.
    
    Here are the conditions for the matching process:
    - Spikes occurring within a range of 4 values from the time of a peak are selected as possible matches.
    - Euclidean distance (channel location x, channel location y, time) is then calculated between a spike and the peak.
    - The closest match is found when the Euclidean distance is less than 100 Î¼m, the least distance we set as a threshold.
    - Once we have iterated through all possible matches, the peak is assigned the unit ID of the matching spike.
    - If there is no spike match, the unit ID for that peak is set to -1.
    
    Once we have completed the spike matching process, a new peaks table will be created with a unit_id column.
