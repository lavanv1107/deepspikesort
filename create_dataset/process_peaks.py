    Match detected peaks with spikes from the NWB file.
    
    Here are the conditions for the matching process:
    - Spikes occurring within a range of 4 values from the sample_index of a peak are selected as possible matches.
    - Euclidean distance (channel location x, channel location y, sample_index) is calculated between a spike and the peak.
    - The closest match is found when the Euclidean distance is less than 100 Î¼m, the least distance we set as a threshold.
    - Once we have iterated through all possible matches, the peak is assigned the unit ID of the matching spike.
    - If there is no spike match, the unit ID for that peak is set to -1.
